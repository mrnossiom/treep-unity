    <h1>About Kromm Studio</h1>
    <p>
      Kromm Studio is a French independent video game studio founded in 2024. It is the product of a collaboration
      between five friends, all linked by their passion for the tenth art. The acronym KROMM stands for Kristen, Romain,
      Oscar, Mahé and Milo.
      <br/>
      Each of us has had the chance to travel, have fun and dream thanks to different works of video game art. That's
      why our aim is to create real adventures that will, in turn, take players on a journey through video games with
      concepts that are fun, challenging or even moving. Because these games are made by enthusiasts for enthusiasts.

        <p>
          I'm Kristen Couty, developer and founding member of Kromm Studio.
          <br />
          For as long as I can remember, the world of video games has been a source of inspiration and fascination for
          me. As a child, I spent hours playing and testing the worlds, characters and mechanics of the games I loved,
          dreaming that one day I'd be able to bring my own ideas to life. Now, with Kromm Studio, that dream has come
          true.
          <br />
          My main role in the team is development, but I also work on certain artistic tasks. Among other things, I
          supervise the development of the multiplayer system and the creation of effects.

        <p class="title">Romain Dischamp</p>
        <p>
          I'm Romain Dischamp, developer, graphic designer and 2D animator, a member of Kromm Studio since its creation.
          <br />
          Ever since I was a child, I've had a dream: to make a video game. That's why Kromm Studio is such a great
          opportunity for me, because it will allow me to achieve a personal goal, but also to put my skills at the
          disposal of the group and finally to improve in different areas thanks to the knowledge of my colleagues.
          <br />
          My profile is a mix of artistic and technical skills, which means I can be both creator and responsible for 2D
          assets, but I'm also in charge of implementing the various basic mechanics and I'm also assisting other
          members in designing a form of AI for our game.

        <p>
          My name is Oscar Cornut, and I've been a developer and game designer at Kromm Studio since it was founded.
          <br />
          I've been passionate about coding since I was very young. I've taken part in a number of competitions,
          including the NSI Trophies and the Night of Code, which have helped me to develop a rigorous approach and a
          strong work ethic.
          <br />
          My role in the team is more technical than graphic, because that's where my skills lie. In practical terms,
          I'm in charge of implementing the AI, enemies and NPCs. I'm also one of those responsible for the game's
          story, by which I mean that I'm helping to build a creative and coherent story. In fact, I really enjoy
          telling stories and reading about them, which is why I play an important role in developing the game's lore
          and characters.

        <p class="title">Milo Moisson</p>
        <p>
          I'm Milo Moisson, developer and project manager at Kromm Studio. I was thrilled to join the development of
          Treep, a project that I find both technically and artistically interesting. My experience in the video game
          industry allows me to guide the team in their technical choices.
          <br />
          I have a dual role on this project. As a developer, I'm mainly responsible for procedural generation, an area
          in which I've proven my ability on previous projects. As project manager, I'm also responsible for
          coordinating the members of the team on the various tasks we have to carry out to complete this mission and
          ensuring the artistic coherence of the project.

        <p class="title">Mahé De-Berranger</p>
        <p>
          My name is Mahé de Berranger. I've always had a passion for music and video game development, and now I'm
          lucky enough to be able to combine these two passions by working at Kromm Studio as a developer and composer.
          <br />
          I've had the opportunity to take part in the development of several video games. These experiences have
          enabled me to acquire solid skills in sound design and programming.
          <br />
          Today, my role at Kromm Studio is multifaceted. I compose the music and design the sound effects that enrich
          our universe, while contributing to the creation of assets, the design of user interfaces, menus, combat
          mechanics and the development of the studio's website.
